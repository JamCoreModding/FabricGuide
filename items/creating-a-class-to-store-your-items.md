# Creating a Class to store your Items

### Introduction

Your ModInitializer may get a bit messy and big if you create and store your item variables in it.

Many known developers usually store their items in a separate class.

### Creating the Class

Lets create the class and move our custom item variable over.

```java
public class MyModItems {
    public static final Item MY_ITEM = new Item(new FabricItemSettings().group(ItemGroups.MISC));
}
```

This seems a bit clunky. Your registry stuff is still in your ModInitializer!

This is where `static {}` comes in.

### Using `static {}` to register your items.

You can use `static {}` to assign your variables. =`static {}` is ran when the class is first referenced.\
Lets add it.

```java
public class MyModItems {
    public static final Item MY_ITEM;
    
    static {
        MY_ITEM = new Item(new FabricItemSettings().group(ItemGroups.MISC));
    }
}
```

However, your registry stuff is still in ModInitializer, lets create a utility method to allow us to register and create blocks at the same time.

Remove your registry stuff from your ModInitializer before continuing.

This should suffice.

```java
public class MyModItems {
    public static final Item MY_ITEM;
    
    static {
        MY_ITEM = new Item(new FabricItemSettings().group(ItemGroups.MISC));
    }
    
    
    private static Item register(String id, Item item) {
            return Registry.register(Registry.ITEM, new Identifier("<mod-id>", id), item);
    }
}
```

Now lets update our `static {}` to use the `new register(String id, Item item)` method.

```java
static {
        MY_ITEM = register("my_item", new Item(new FabricItemSettings().group(ItemGroups.MISC)));
}
```

You are now assigning your variable and registering it at the same time. Pretty cool huh ðŸ‘Œ

However, when you run the game. Your blocks aren't showing up. This is because your items class isn't being referenced anywhere. We'll need to initialize the class.

### Creating an `Initializer()` method.

The initializer method doesn't need to contain any code. It just needs to exist because whenever you use init() for the first time you are essentially loading the class

```java
public static void init() { }
```

You can now use this in your ModInitializer:

```java
public void onInitalize() {
    // ...
    MyModItems.init()
}
```
