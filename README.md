# Introduction

## A Quick Note

You can probably see that this Guide is heavily WIP. We're constantly developing it, if you would like to contribute or help maintain it, please read the information [here](https://github.com/JamCoreModding/FabricTutorials)

## Prerequisites

The content of this Wiki assumes you know basic Java and JSON knowledge, and have a copy of the example mod ready to be used, along with a setup IDE. You can find instructions to do all of this on the [official Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup)

If you want to learn more about Minecraft's internals, read this [page](how-does-minecraft-work.md)

## Format

When you see a field surrounded by angular brackets, it indicates you need to fill this in yourself. For example, if you see `<MOD ID>` you need to replace that with your mod id (such as `awesomefabricmod`)

Any pages titled "**Required Resources**" contain infomation on what JSON files are required.

## Why use this Guide?

[We](contributors.md#editors) created this guide because the official Fabric Wiki is somewhat hard to navigate and looks dated.

However, the official Fabric Wiki is sometimes a great place to find out technical, advanced infomation that isn't listed on this guide.

## FAQ

Q. What Minecraft version is targeted?\
A. This guide tries to stay up to date with the latest release
