# Introduction

## A Quick Note

You can probably see that this Guide is heavily WIP. We're constantly developing it, if you would like to contribute or help maintain it, please read the information [here](https://github.com/JamCoreModding/FabricTutorials).

This wiki targets the [Quilt mod loader](htps://quiltmc.org), which for the most part has parity with Fabric.

This guide is currently focusing on topics not covered by the official Fabric wiki, such as the game test API. We hope to contribute to the official Quilt wiki once it is created.

## Prerequisites

The content of this Wiki assumes you have basic Java, Gradle and JSON knowledge, and have a copy of the example mod ready to be used, along with a setup IDE. You can find instructions to do all of this on the [official Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup).

If you want to learn more about Minecraft's internals before starting, read this [page](how-does-minecraft-work.md).

## Why use this Guide?

[We](contributors.md#editors) created this guide because the official Fabric Wiki is somewhat hard to navigate and looks dated. However, the official Fabric Wiki is sometimes a great place to find out technical, advanced information that isn't listed on this guide.
